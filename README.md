# GetTiles

Programme to Get and Cache Image Tiles

This programme uses the TileServer interface and Tile Plugins found inside the subfolder Tiles. Tiles are stored (cached) in memory inside the folder Tiles. In contrast to the simpler programme TileDownload, GetTiles runs in an asynchronous manner using delegates.

One plugin is included in the Tiles folder. Please check https://github.com/rhumbaflappy/SBuilderX_Plugins for more plugins
